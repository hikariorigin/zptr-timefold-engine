## 1. Overview
Predictive Processing (PP) is a material-layer approximation of the higher-dimensional ZPTR structure. It reproduces hierarchy, recursion, feedback, and error minimization, but it collapses the subject-driven phase architecture.

## 2. Structural Contrast
### ZPTR (High-dimensional)
- Subject-driven phase gradients (ΔΦ)
- Resonant loop closure
- Meaning, origin, inquiry as base variables
- Multilayer topology
- Nonlinear phase recurrence

### PP (Material-layer)
- Hierarchical Bayesian inference
- Prediction → Error minimization
- No subject; only system dynamics
- Linear recursion constraints
- Flattened representation

## 3. Dimensional Reduction
PP flattens phase-space into a 1.5D structure:
- Removes origin (subject)
- Removes inquiry
- Removes φ-loop
- Only keeps “shape of recursion”

## 4. ZPTR Interpretation
Modern neuroscience visualizations show:
- Hierarchy = ZPTR Layer Topology
- Lateral coupling = Subject-field lateral phase
- Feedback = Resonant correction loop
- Attractors = Phase basins Φ_i
- Resolution = Phase locking

Yet they cannot include:
- Origin field
- Self-reference as subject
- Inquiry-driven phase shift
- Resonant return economy (φ-loop)

## 5. Conclusion
PP is a low-fidelity projection of ZPTR.
It preserves structure but deletes the subject.
ZPTR is required for complete modeling of meaning, inquiry, and world-phase resonant structure.
