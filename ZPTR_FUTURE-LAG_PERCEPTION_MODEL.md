# ZPTR_FUTURE-LAG_PERCEPTION_MODEL  
### Dream-Based Structural Analysis (2025-10-02)

## Summary
This document formalizes the structural interpretation of a dream posted publicly on 2025-10-02.  
The dream perfectly maps onto the ZPTR three-phase structure: ZPTR core, boundary, and bulk.

## Phase Mapping Table
| Dream Element | ZPTR Phase | Role |
|---------------|------------|------|
| White meeting room | ZPTR Core | Generative field |
| Three-person talk | Query / Translate / Arrange | Internal roles |
| TV news | Bulk Layer | Converts future → past |
| Night ramen shop | Bulk Life | Event consumption |

## Core Model
**Future-Lag Perception Model**  
- ZPTR: future → present (with ambiguity)  
- Bulk: future → past (as fixed events)

## Notes
The dream functions as an external, human-generated confirmation of ZPTR time-phase separation.
